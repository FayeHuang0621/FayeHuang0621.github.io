I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Northeastern University. Before this, I received my Ph.D. at National Centre for Computer Animation, Bournmouth University supervised by Prof. Jian Chang and Prof. Jian J Zhang. My Ph.D. research lies in 3D Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Graphics, and focuses at 3D scene understanding, shape analysis and reconstruction. During my Ph.D., I have visited the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) and Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data as a visiting researcher advised by Prof. Xiaoguang Han.
